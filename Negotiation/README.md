### Deciding To Do It
1. Biggest reason we don't negotiate is that we don't even try. We decide not to negotiate at all for various reason like pride issue, we have to overcome all these fears and barriers for us to start negotiating
2. What stops us from negotiating? 
   - Afraid of people laughing at you when you ask for lower price
   - Thinking of negotiating is a waste of time
   - Have a mindset like "Oh it is not going to work", well never try never know, practise more often to know how can we be in the situation where we are [psychological empowered](https://youtu.be/qS_VWG3JEZg?t=47)
3. Motivation for negotiating
   - The seller probably laughing at you that you are buying some ugly things for such a high price
4. Over coming embarrasment and pride
   - You like game? Take negotiation as a everyday game
   - Practise as you play the nogtiation game, in the end when you acquiring something expensive, you know how you can be in the power of the negotiation game, saving you huge bucks
5. Use "Yes but can we...?" rather than `Yes` or `No.` 
   - But be sure to create some condition where the situation is a win-win situation for both of the parties
   - If you are asked to do a service which is quite far and you are unwilling to go, just negotiate by increaseing the cost of your service, they probably just find other alternative
6. Now you might be wandering that you might lose most of your deals and job opportunity through negotiation, don't be as there are only two outcomes: you walk away or they walk out.
   - Be nice, don't be rude when negotiating
   - Always blame on yourself for instance: Oh that's a good phone but I don't think I am able to afford it, could you do a better price for me?
   - It is okay to walk away without buying it when the price the party set is not meeting your expectation but sometimes when the party you are dealing with is the only option, go back to them as soon as possible and pay in the price they wanted initially ASAP, don't wait for a day or more, directly take the price because if you wait one day or more and go back, they know you are in urgent and they might increase the price
7. When should we negotiate?
   - When we get an easy offer say 10% off meaning the seller is keen to sell it, this crucial moment means we can ask for more reduciton like 20%
   - When we have complaint to make

### Planning
1. Planning is the most important thing in negotiation before you think how you should approach them to negotiate
2. Set your walk-away point and never ever go beyond this. Walk-away point as in the limit you set, if it reach more than a limit, don't go beyond it, walk away proves that you have clear fixed decision. 
   - You are going for giving a service, if they negotiate less than your price you set, just walk away, show them you have the power
   - You are negotiating price with a factory owner based on the materials you would like to quote on, assuming there are many options of factories out there, say you would like to get the materials at a reasonable price at 9Mils but the original price was 10M, the factory owner say 9.2M, you will think it is a good deal but you shouldn't take the deal once you have ask for 9M, you should never show them that you are not strong in your decision as they will take your weakness for the next negotiation. They know you will definitely accept their price.
   - Always always set your walk-away point carefully, make sure it is reasonable price
3. Internal and external factor
   - Internal factor: Walk away point (Internal feeling: How much you need it, how much you value that thing that you want to get. In short, you have the internal value that how much you are willing to pay)
     - If you are buying, your walk away point can be quite high
     - But if you are selling, your walk away point can be quite low in order for you to hit your monthly sales
   - External factor: Opening offer (External competitor: Market price)
     - If you are buying, the opening offer of course need to be low
     - But if you are selling, your opening offer must be high
   - Market affects the offer price but never let it affect your walk away point
   - Don't say what price you expect first when you are buying, ask them to open an offer first, because it might be good news where the price is lower than the expectation price that you have, if the price is higher, only then you negotiate
4. Tradables
   - Prepare the list of tradables as in for each of the new feature the trader is giving, how much would you be willing to add the money on with the base price, understand the list can help you in the negotiation game later
   - If you want the negotiation to be a success, never let the negotiation ending be unilaterally concede by one party, if you are able to think of a condition where it is a win-win situation for both of the parties, then the success rate of your negotiation is higher
5. Some good questions to have during planning:
   - What MUST we get?
   - What is our plan B if we end up walking away?
   - What is it worth to us (the most we'll pay)? / What's the least we'll take?
   - What do we expect the finished deal to look like?
   - What might we get (the best we can expect)?
   - What will our opening offer be?
   - How will we justify this opening position?
   - What extras can we ask for?
   - What extras can we offer?
   - What extras are they likely to be looking for?
   - What extras might they be able to give easily / cheaply?
   - What weaknesses might they have that will cause them to give more away to us?
   - What fears might they have?
   - What is to be our overall attitude?
   - What is our overall strategy? (e.g. total package then take bits off, basic price then add bits on, focus on one part while casually mentioning another, etc.)
   - What tactics will we be using? (e.g. Vice, Salami, Higher Authority, Reluctant Buyer/Seller, Knocking the Product, Broken Record, Quivering Pen, Nibble.
   - What tactics are they likely to use? What claims will they make?
6. Finding the weaknesses of the opposite party
   - Don't dwell on our own weaknesses, analyze the possible weaknesses of the opposite to try to negotiate
   - Maybe they are keen to sell
     - Sales target
     - They want a long term relationship, so this deal is important
     - They have excess stock
     - They want to make money from later orders, add-ons and services
   - Maybe they are weak
     - The product is slow-moving
     - They need the work (workforce or machines standing idle)
     - Very high margin to start with
     - They know the weaknesses in their product
     - They don't realise that they are unique
     - They know of other suppliers or substitutes
   - Maybe you have power
     - You are the only customer for this product
     - Your custom is strategic for them
     - They have a fear of you finding another supplier
     - They have a fear of your changing the design so as to be able to substitute
   - Maybe they are keen to sell to you
     - You always pay on time
     - They like you as a company
     - He likes you as a person
     - He has been told he has to sell to you
     - Your business adds to their buying power
   - Keep trying before you are ready to crumble (Give up negotiating and pay the amount)
   - Same goes to when the opposition is the only supplier you have, but make sure they have their weaknesses first

### Opening Offers
1. Don't offer first
2. Less talking, more questions and listening before opening an offer
   - Ask them about budget, previous supplier, what are their costs
   - Most of the time, people are honest and will tell you the truth (giving you the power)
   - Don't show your interest in the things that they are selling, for eg. "Oh I love this house!"
   - Give away as little information about yourself as you can
3. Setting your opening offer
   - Opening offer is not your tender bid (The lowest price you can give)
     - If you are buying, the opening offer must be lower than your tender bid, for example if you have a base price of 700, always ask for 600 or lower of course you know it will not work at 600 but you slowly add little by little
       - What you expect: 900
       - What you might get: 700
       - How much you should offer to get what you might get: 600
     - If you are selling, then you should ask for more first then work the way down to your walk away point
     - Always justify why you offer such low or why you ask for such high cost
4. Don't open with a round number
   - Rather than asking for $270,000 you should ask for like $267,500 something that shows that you really measure the value of the things you are getting
   - No one has ever ask for a negotiation with this unusual quotes
5. Flinch: Always look unhappy when they open a price
   - If they didn't flinch after you flinch, then you can stick to your base price
   - If they flinch after you flinch, you know it is a signal to up the price a little bit
   - Don't let them think you are happy
6. Ambitious opener
   - Negotiating is fine, you will think it's fine after negotiating
   - Rule #0: Wear simple, don't show off
   - Rule #1: Set your limit (Internally set: how much I need the table, how much I like the table)
   - Ask the price first, if the price is too high, walk away to see if it activated negotiation from the seller
   - Once the seller keep reducing the price, and you still don't accept the offer, they will ask you how much you are willing to pay
   - You say a price which is lower than the limit you chose: Give it a try
   - Make sure your offer is not round number
   - Offering is not as outrageous as you think
7. As a seller
   - You trade, don't reduce the price too quick
   - As you reduce, ask to buy something else, or not include free delivery etc
   - You trade the discount with something else
